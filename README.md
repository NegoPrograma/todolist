Altough it's utterly important to advise those who shall use, there isn't a login system, so if someone types your custom URL, they can create and delete tasks. Make sure to make it as unique as possible. It's a to-do list parallel to dontpad.com, in which multiple people can use the same custom URL to write at the same space!
